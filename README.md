# randomCardsTaken
A total of 50 cards are numbered sequentially,
1-50, Determine how many cards must be drawn, so that it is guaranteed that the total number of cards drawn is between 25 and 100 (inclusive)

This is the sample from 100000 random sample, which consist taking 1-50 cards.

This problem came from my first quiz on Discrete Mathematics Class

I created this simulation because I saw my friends' answer, where they assumed that the cards are being taken in order (1,2,3,...,etc), hence their answer was
between 7 and 13, but the simulation that ran through 100000 sample showed that the optimal solution was to take between 2 and 5 cards.

I created this simulation because I don't really know how to prove it in terms of 'Mathematical' way.
